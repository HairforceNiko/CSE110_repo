#Fangqi Yuan's Profile
Hello, my name is **Fangqi Yuan** and I'm currently a senior student in **UC San Diego**.

##As a programmer 
I have complete several internship during past two years in ICBC(**Industrial and Commercial Bank of China**) and **Shanghai Shiyou Company**.

Wiki of ICBC [ICBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_Commercial_Bank_of_China).

I'm good at writing Java and SQL code and debug existing programs.

I love what Bill Gates say:
> Life is not fair; get used to it.

I also love code named QuickSort:
```
quickSort(arr[], low, high)
{
    if (low < high)
    {
        /* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now
           at right place */
        pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);  // Before pi
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high); // After pi
    }
}
```
Above code is from [QuickSort GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/).
